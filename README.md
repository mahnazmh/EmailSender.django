# EmailSender.django

For sending and testing this, you need to go to your google accounts and click manage google accounts after that a new window will open. It will open the settings page.
Go to the security option under the sidebar and then click on App password. A picture is shown below for a better understanding.
When we will click generate it will generate a 16-digit code which we will use in EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD field in settings.py file.
Then replace :
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "your email adress"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "16 digit code generated by gmail"

So run it  and send an email to another email address!
GOOD LUCK!
